            </div>Background In a Spring Boot project, an entity class has a @CreationTimestamp annotation for the field of started. Since this field is essential for our business logic, there is a NotNull restriction in the database column for it.
This is the code for this entity (Review.java):
@Entity(name = &#34;review&#34;) @EqualsAndHashCode(onlyExplicitlyIncluded = true) @TypeDef(name = &#34;jsonb&#34;, typeClass = JsonBinaryType.class) @TypeDef(name = &#34;pgsql_enum&#34;, typeClass = PostgreSQLEnumType.class) @Getter @Setter @JsonIgnoreProperties({&#34;hibernateLazyInitializer&#34;, &#34;handler&#34;}) public class Review { @Id @EqualsAndHashCode.]]></description></item><item><title>Potential Issues With Spring Jpa Properties You Should Avoid in Production</title><link>https://williamyuaus.com/2023/03/potential-issues-with-spring-jpa-properties-you-should-avoid-in-production/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 2023 15:34:29 +1100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://williamyuaus.com/2023/03/potential-issues-with-spring-jpa-properties-you-should-avoid-in-production/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>Introduction Java developers love the Spring Framework since it has gained immense popularity due to its simplicity, flexibility, and robustness. Spring is a powerful tool that simplifies the development of enterprise applications by providing various features and functionalities. One such feature is the Spring Data JPA, which is an abstraction over the JPA specification. Although Spring Boot provides a powerful auto-configuration feature that makes it easy to configure and set up various components of an application, misconfiguring certain properties can lead to unintended consequences and potential issues.</description></item></channel></rss>
