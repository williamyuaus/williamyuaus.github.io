            </div>Intro If we need to generate a PDF from a webpage by puppeteer, we do not want to display any error notification popup on it. That&rsquo;s the situation I was working on. It is a Vue Project. On the browser, when a REST API call failed, there would be showing a notification popup on the screen. If we need to generate a PDF version based on the webpage, the popup will stick on the output.]]></description></item><item><title>Potential Issues With Spring Jpa Properties You Should Avoid in Production</title><link>https://williamyuaus.com/2023/03/potential-issues-with-spring-jpa-properties-you-should-avoid-in-production/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 2023 15:34:29 +1100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://williamyuaus.com/2023/03/potential-issues-with-spring-jpa-properties-you-should-avoid-in-production/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>Introduction Java developers love the Spring Framework since it has gained immense popularity due to its simplicity, flexibility, and robustness.

Fortunately, we still can find a way to do the unit testing for the Vue Router Global After Hooks
Background In my project, I have implemented afterEach as global after hooks in my Vue router settings.</description></item><item><title>Fix Generating Equals/hashcode Implementation but Without a Call to Superclass</title><link>https://williamyuaus.com/2022/08/fix-generating-equalshashcode-implementation-but-without-a-call-to-superclass/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2022 18:40:03 +1000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://williamyuaus.com/2022/08/fix-generating-equalshashcode-implementation-but-without-a-call-to-superclass/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

<p>To develop a single-page application, Spring Boot and Vue can be a good choice. When you finished the development stage, it is time to deploy the app online.</p>
<p>Traditionally, you may need to write scripts to start your java service, and you need to do a lot of configuration for the Nginx server.</p>
<p>To make the process easier and more efficient, I would recommend using Docker to deploy the app. You may find it a little bit difficult to learn at the beginning, but you will benefit from the learning since Docker could help you a lot.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Fix 413 Request Entity Too Large Error</title><link>https://williamyuaus.com/2021/08/fix-413-request-entity-too-large-error/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 14:20:09 +1000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://williamyuaus.com/2021/08/fix-413-request-entity-too-large-error/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
